#Bachelorproef-ReactJS

##Description

My PReact prototype, created to test the functionality differences between the average ReactJS app and its' PreactJS counterpart. Technologies used include Redux, routing, nested components, et cetera.

Based on the preact-cli created by @developit:

`$ preact create <template-name> <project-name>`
